Implementing logistic regression for binary classification training and assignment based on the supervised Machine learning course that I took in DeepLearning.AI and Stanford University and offered through Coursera
In this project, I build a logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university.
Suppose that i am the administrator of a university department and i want to determine each applicant’s chance of admission based on their results on two exams.
I have historical data from previous applicants that i can use as a training set for logistic regression.
For each training example, i have the applicant’s scores on two exams and the admissions decision.
my task is to build a classification model that estimates an applicant’s probability of admission based on the scores from those two exams.
